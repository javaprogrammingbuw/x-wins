# Todo:
* Implement the game X Wins which is a modification of the game [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four):
  * At the beginning width, height and number of stones can be entered. By pressing compute, the field is computed with this properties.
  * Each player can place a stone. The resulting position of the stone should be set with respect to the gravity, like in the original game. This means that by pressing any field in a column, the stone is placed in the lowest free row of this column. (One cannot have two stones in the same field. Once a stone is placed, it cannot be moved.)
  * Check for the end of the game. A player wins if he or she has x stones in one line (horizontal, vertical or diagonal)
